# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning 🔬

This project aims to accurately predict breast cancer (benign or malignant) using various machine learning classification algorithms. After thorough experimentation, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** achieved the highest accuracy of **97% 🎯**.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

We implemented and compared the performance of the following classification models:

- 🌳 Decision Tree (DT)
- 📈 Logistic Regression (LG)
- 📊 Support Vector Machine (SVM) ✅ *[Best Performer — 97% Accuracy!]*
- 🕊️ Naive Bayes (NB)
- 🌲 Random Forest (RF)

## 🧪 Dataset

- Source: [UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))
- Features: 30 real-valued input features
- Target: Malignant / Benign
